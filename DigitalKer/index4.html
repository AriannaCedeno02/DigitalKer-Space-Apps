                    <h3><span>1</span>The Challenger disaster.</h3>
                    <p>The era of space shuttles had begun in 1972, after the end of the Apollo missions.
                    On January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated 73 seconds after launch, killing all seven of the crew, including Christa McAuliffe, the first teacher selected for the "Master in Space" program.</p>
                    <h3><span>2</span>Disaster investigation</h3>
                    <p>The famous American physicist Richard Feynman was a member of the commission that investigated the disaster.
                    The commission determined that the tragedy was caused by a faulty rubber seal, called an O-ring. The function of the gasket, in English O-ring, was to seal two compartments of the external rocket fuel used by the shuttle.
                    The final report also highlighted a catastrophic lack of communication between NASA engineers and administrators, subject to pressure to launch an especially media mission.
                    Engineers believed it was better to postpone the launch, since it was known since the 1970s that at low temperatures the seals could have problems. And the planned day for launch was unusually cold at Cape Canaveral.</p>
                    <h3><span>3</span>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p>While NASA administrators claimed there was a 1 in 100,000 chance of a major failure, Feynman found that NASA's own engineers had estimated the probability of a catastrophe to be about a 1 in 200.
                    In a dramatic hearing, Feynman illustrated the defects of the rubber gasket by putting a piece of the material compressed by a small carpenter's press in a glass with ice. When releasing the material from the press, the gasket did not regain its original shape, in other words, the low temperatures affected its behavior.
                    The physicist summarized his conclusions in a phrase that became famous: "For a successful technology, reality must prevail over public relations, nature cannot be deceived.".</p>
