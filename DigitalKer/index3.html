                    <h3><span>1</span>Voyager 1 and 2 Probes </h3>
                    <p>Voyager 1 and 2 probes were launched by NASA in 1977 and are the furthest human-sent instrument ever. In 2013 Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to reach interstellar space (the region that mediates between stars).</p>
                    <h3><span>2</span>Sounds of the Earth</h3>
                    <p>Both probes carry with them "Sounds of the Earth", a gold record that includes recordings of greetings in different languages, and music from around the world, including compositions by Beethoven and Bach and a song by Chuck Berry. "</p>
                    <h3><span>3</span>Nasa</h3>
                    <p>In 1990 NASA, at the suggestion of astronomer Carl Sagan, turned the probe back once before continuing to go into space to capture an image of Earth.</p>
                    <h3><span>4</span>the Pale Blue Point book</h3>
                    <p>The famous photo taken some 6,000 million km from our planet inspired Sagan's book "Pale Blue Point" and shows a tiny point in the cosmic vastness."That's our home, that's us, all the people you know and love and everyone who ever lived lives there," Sagan said of the image in a speech at Cornell University.
                    "There is perhaps no better demonstration of the madness of human pride than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to treat each other more kindly and compassionately, and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot. , the only home we've ever known. " </p>
