                    <h3><span>1</span>Martian House and Lab on Wheels</h3>
                    <p>To reduce the number of items needed to land on the surface, NASA will combine the first Martian home and vehicle into a single mobile cabin complete with breathable air.

                    NASA has conducted extensive robotic tests on Earth to develop a pressurized mobile home on the Moon. Artemis astronauts living and working in the future pressurized lunar rover will be able to offer recommendations to help refine rover skills for astronauts on Mars. NASA rovers will also help with Martian design, from selecting the best wheels for Mars, to how a larger vehicle will navigate the difficult terrain.

                    Like an RV, the pressurized rover will have everything astronauts need to live and work for weeks. They can drive in comfortable clothing, tens of kilometers from the spacecraft that will propel them into space for the journey back to Earth. When they come across interesting places, astronauts can don their high-tech spacesuits to exit the rover and collect samples and conduct science experiments.</p>
                    <h3><span>2</span>Uninterrupted power</h3>
                    <p>Just like we use electricity to charge our devices on Earth, astronauts will need a safe power source to explore Mars. The system should be lightweight and capable of operating regardless of its location or the weather on the red planet.

                    Mars has a day and night cycle like Earth and periodic dust storms that can last for months, making nuclear fission power a more reliable option than solar power. NASA has already tested the technology on Earth and has shown that it is safe, efficient and abundant enough to allow long duration surface missions. NASA plans to demonstrate and use the fission energy system on the Moon first, then on Mars.</p>
                    <h3><span>3</span>Laser communications to send more information home</h3>
                    <p>Human missions to Mars can use lasers to stay in contact with Earth. A laser communications system on Mars could send large amounts of information and data in real time, including high-definition images and video.

                    Sending a map of Mars to Earth can take nine years with today's radio systems, but only nine weeks with laser communications. Technology would also allow us to communicate with astronauts, to see and hear more about their adventures on the Red Planet.

                    NASA demonstrated that laser communications are possible with a demonstration of the Moon in 2013. The agency's next demonstration will work through different operational scenarios, refine the targeting system, and address the technological challenges of low Earth orbit, such as clouds. and other communications interruptions. NASA is building small systems to test human spaceflight, including on the International Space Station and Artemis' first manned mission. Another laser communications payload will venture into deep space to help inform what it takes to use the same technology millions and millions of miles from Earth.</p>
