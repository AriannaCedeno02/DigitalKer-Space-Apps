                    <h3><span>1</span>Arrival on Mars </h3>
                    <p>The Mars Pathfinder spacecraft, launched in 1996, was the first to land on the red planet since the Viking program in 1976.
                    In 2004, the Mars Spirit and Opportunity rovers, equipped with panoramic cameras and spectrometers for geological investigations, arrived on the red planet.</h3>
                    <p>Both probes carry with them "Sounds of the Earth", a gold record that includes recordings of greetings in different languages, and music from around the world, including compositions by Beethoven and Bach and a song by Chuck Berry. "</p>
                    <h3><span>3</span>NASA communication</h3>
                    <p>NASA lost communication with Spirit in 2011 and there is no news from Opportunity since a sandstorm affected its solar panels in June of this year.
                    Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012 and is as popular as Instagram stars for its many selfies.</p>
                    <h3><span>4</span>Scout vehicles</h3>
                    <p>The rover found signs of salty water near the surface of Mars in Gale Crater in 2015. And this year he found complex organic molecules in 3 billion-year-old rocks that indicate that the planet may have supported life in the past. </p>
