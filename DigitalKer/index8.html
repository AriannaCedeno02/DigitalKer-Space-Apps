                    <h3><span>1</span>Powerful powertrains to get us there and back (home!) Faster. </h3>
                    <p>Astronauts bound for Mars will travel approximately 225 million kilometers into deep space. Advances in propulsion capabilities are the key to getting to our destination as quickly and safely as possible. It's too early to say which propulsion system will get astronauts to Mars, but we know it must be nuclear-powered to cut down on travel time. NASA is advancing multiple options, including nuclear-electric or nuclear-only propulsion. They both use nuclear fission, but they are very different from each other. A nuclear electric rocket is more efficient but does not generate much thrust however nuclear thermal propulsion provides much more "thrust".

                    Whichever system is selected, the fundamentals of nuclear propulsion will reduce the crew's time on their journey away from Earth. The agency and its partners are developing, testing, and maturing critical components of various propulsion technologies to minimize the risks of the first human mission to Mars.</p>
                    <h3><span>2</span>Inflatable heat shield for landing astronauts on other planets.</h3>
                    <p>The largest rover we've ever landed on Mars is the size of a car, and sending humans to Mars will require a much larger spacecraft. New technologies will allow heavier spacecraft to enter the Martian atmosphere, approach the surface, and land close to where astronauts want to explore.

                    NASA is working on a rocket with an inflatable heat shield that allows the large surface area to take up less space than a rigid one. The technology could land spacecraft on any planet with an atmosphere. In the case of Mars, it would expand and inflate before entering the Martian atmosphere to land cargo and astronauts safely.

                    The technology is not ready for the Red Planet yet. An upcoming flight test of a 6-meter-diameter prototype will demonstrate how the aeroshell works as it enters Earth's atmosphere. The test will show if it can survive the intense heat during the entrance to Mars.</p>
                    <h3><span>3</span>High Tech Martian Spacesuits</h3>
                    <p>Spacesuits are essentially custom spaceships for astronauts. NASA's latest spacesuit is so high-tech that its modular design is designed to evolve for use anywhere in space.

                    The first woman and the next man on the Moon will wear NASA's next-generation spacesuits, called the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or xEMU. The spacesuits will prioritize the safety of the crew while also allowing Artemis Generation moonwalkers to perform more natural, Earth-like movements and perform tasks that were not possible during the Apollo missions.

                    Future updates to address differences on Mars may include technology for life-support functionality in the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and modified outerwear to keep astronauts warm during the Martian winter and prevent overheating in the winter season. summer.</p>
